He suffers from sciatica. For a period in his 40s he saw a psychoanalyst to \"clear up some things.\" His favorite film is Fellini's \"La Strada\" followed closely by \"Rome, Open City\" with a fondness too for \"Babette's Feast.\"\n\nHere are a few facts about Pope Francis, as well as some highlights from five years with a very different kind of pope.\n\n-Sept. 21, 2014: When he wept hearing the life story of a priest, the Rev. Ernest Simoni, who was tortured and imprisoned during Albania's communist rule. Francis later made Simoni a cardinal.\n\n-Oct. 1, 2016: When he was spellbound by the haunting Aramaic chant sung by a young Georgian girl and a monk in the Orthodox cathedral outside Tblisi. Francis was later snubbed by the Orthodox hierarchy at his open-air Mass in the Georgian capital.\n\n-Dec. 1, 2017: When his already whispery voice weakened as he met with Myanmar's Rohingya refugees and told them \"The presence of God today is also called Rohingya.\"\n\n-June 8, 2014: When Francis hosted the Israeli and Palestinian presidents for a peace prayer in the Vatican gardens. Full-scale conflict broke out in the Gaza Strip a few weeks later.\n\n-Sept. 24, 2015: When he challenged the U.S. Congress to rediscover America's ideals by taking action on climate change, immigration and poverty reduction. The speech was the first by a pope at the U.S. capitol.\n\n-Feb. 12, 2016: When he met with the Russian Orthodox patriarch in the first such encounter in over 1,000 years. The meeting took place in the geopolitically and geographically convenient airport of Havana, as Francis was travelling to Mexico.\n\nSEEMINGLY LIGHT BUT ULTIMATELY TELLING MOMENTS:\n\n-March 14, 2013: When he paid his bill and checked out of the Rome residence after he had been elected pope. The gesture set the stage for a papacy of simple, humble gestures.\n\n-Nov. 30, 2015: When he invited the imam of Bangui to join him in his popemobile for a spin through the besieged, divided Central African Republic capital in a sign of Christian-Muslim coexistence.\n\n-Jan. 18, 2018: When he married two Chilean flight attendants at 35,000 feet after their church wedding was canceled due to an earthquake.\n\n-Francis doesn't much care for \"selfies\" but tolerates posing for them because that's what kids these days do.\n\n-He hasn't watched television since June 15, 1990, when he made a promise to the Virgin Mary that he wouldn't.\n\n-He likes Caravaggio and Chagall, Mozart and Bach. His preferred literary references run from Dostoyevsky to Borges and the Argentine epic poem \"Martin Fierro.\"\n\n-He has a temper, admits to having an \"authoritative\" bent and has been known to curse like a sailor.\n\n-He rises at 4:30 a.m., takes a siesta after lunch and is asleep by 10 p.m.\n\n-He carries a razor and breviary prayer book in the worn black satchel he carries on trips.\n\n-He heats his own food in the Vatican hotel dining room microwave.","title":"Some fun facts about Pope Francis at the 5-year mark","url":"http:\/\/hosted.ap.org\/dynamic\/stories\/E\/EU_REL_VATICAN_FRANCIS_FUN_FACTS?SITE=NCHIC&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT","uri":"829804483","eventUri":null,"dateTime":"2018-03-12T09:55:00Z","date":"2018-03-12","source":{"title":"Associated Press","id":"2028","uri":"hosted.ap.org"},"time":"09:55:00","isDuplicate":true,"wgt":3,"id":"226282235","sim":0},{"lang":"hrv","body":"Seksipilna Italijanka sebe opisuje kao osobu avanturisti\u010dkog duha koja obo\u017eava prirodu, sanjarenje, ali i modu\n\nSilvija Karuzo miljenica je dru\u0161tvenih mre\u017ea.

Non saprei. Quello che ripeto sempre \u00e8 che nei miei film faccio sempre molti sbagli. Cio\u00e8 commetto molti errori apposta, perch\u00e9 se in una ricostruzione \u00e8 tutto perfetto, sembra un set cinematografico, non \u00e8 la vita. Mentre se ci guardiamo intorno, se andiamo in giro, i luoghi, le case, la nostra vita \u00e8 disseminata di errori, nulla \u00e8 perfetto. Ecco perch\u00e9 sbaglio volutamente, perch\u00e9 solo in questo modo quello che creo \u00e8 credibile\".\n\nEntrare nello studio di Dante Ferretti a Cinecitt\u00e0 \u00e8 come essere testimoni di un piccolo prodigio: il prodigio dell'arte che salva se stessa in ogni condizione e nonostante tutto. Accade quando la creativit\u00e0, per prodursi, ha bisogno solo di un tratto, di un foglio, di una matita.\n\nLa sua opera \u00e8 l'emblema della artigianalit\u00e0 che diventa eccellenza.\n\nDall'ingresso principale di Cinecitt\u00e0 fino alla porta dello studio dello scenografo tre volte premio Oscar si percorre un viale che un tempo ha visto l'et\u00e0 d'oro del cinema italiano e oggi non \u00e8 che il transito per le macchine delle produzioni televisive: fiction, fiction, fiction. Segno del tempo che passa e che impone i gusti della modernit\u00e0.\n\nIl prodigio diventa inchino oltre la porta di vetro e alluminio, a destra i bozzetti, in alto fotografie e quadri. Al centro il tavolo da disegno al centro, in fondo nella stanza a fianco, foto, decine di foto e una parte dei premi (oltre ai tre Oscar, sette nomination, cinque David di Donatello, tredici Nastri d'Argento). Colpisce immaginare come in questi pochi, tutto sommato, metri quadrati si costruisca la capacit\u00e0 di far sognare. Nel tempo della digitalizzazione estrema qui si respira odor di colori: l'idea che diventa forma attraversi le mani e il corpo. Niente, o quasi niente, effetti speciali.\n\nDante Ferretti \u00e8 appena rientrato dagli Stati Uniti, da Miami, dove ha una casa: \u00e8 negli Usa che ormai si svolge prevalentemente il suo lavoro. Sulla scrivania il copione del prossimo film di Martin Scorsese.\n\nAllungo lo sguardo, Ferretti copre la copertina con una mano. Non si pu\u00f2? No, non si pu\u00f2, mi dice, con gentilezza.\n\nDa Bellocchio, Zampa, Petri, Citti, Cavani, Ferreri, Comencini, Scola, Zeffirelli, solo per citare alcuni tra italiani, ma anche Gilliam, Burton, De Palma, tra gli americani, Ferretti ha lavorato con tutti. Ma sono tre i nomi che hanno segnato la sua filmografia: Fellini, Pasolini e Scorsese.\n\n\"Con Fellini, con cui ho fatto cinque film - dice - siamo stati legati da una vera amicizia. Spesso trascorrevamo insieme anche il tempo libero, come quando andavamo al mare a Fregene a mangiare il pesce con Giulietta (Masina, ndr), con mia moglie e i miei figli. Quando lavoravamo insieme venivamo spesso insieme a Cinecitt\u00e0 con la sua macchina, abitavamo vicini, lui in via Margutta io invece in via Del Babbuino. Allora passava a prendermi e tutte le mattine mi chiedeva \"Dantino, che ti sei sognato?\". Le prime volte rispondevo la verit\u00e0 e cio\u00e8 niente, che non avevo sognato niente, poi ho capito che dovevo inventarmi qualcosa\".\n\nDomando: ma davvero si \u00e8 inventato i sogni che raccontava a Fellini? Sorride: \"Venivamo entrambi dalla provincia, io sono nato a Macerata, cos\u00ec abbiamo conosciuto pi\u00f9 o meno lo stesso mondo. Ad esempio, il mio ricordo di quando da bambino accompagnavo mia madre dalla sarta e mi abbassavo per guardarle le gambe, mi pare che sia finito nella Citt\u00e0 delle donne. Fellini sapeva che mi inventavo tutto, ma si divertiva ugualmente, gli interessava capire fin dove mi spingevo con la fantasia\". Scopriamo cos\u00ec che le visioni di Mastroianni erano invece i sogni di Dante Ferretti. Empatia che si plasma sulla confidenza. Carattere diretto quello di Ferretti, da subito. \"Ero appena rientrato dalla Cappadocia dove avevo fatto Medea con Pasolini, quando qui a Cinecitt\u00e0 incontro Fellini che mi fa: \"Dantino, so che hai fatto Medea con Pasolini. Guarda che il prossimo film lo devi fare con me\". Gli risposi di richiamarmi dopo dieci anni. S\u00ec gli dissi: \"Ma perch\u00e9 vuole rovinarmi la carriera che sono agli inizi, ritroviamoci tra dieci anni quando avr\u00f2 pi\u00f9 esperienza\". Avrei dovuto fare il film con Danilo Donati che si occupava anche dei costumi. Allora feci questo ragionamento: se fosse andato tutto bene il merito sarebbe stato suo, in caso contrario, se le cose fossero andate male, la colpa sarebbe stata mia. No grazie, meglio aspettare\".\n\nE con Pasolini? \"Con lui avevo un bellissimo rapporto, abbiamo sempre lavorato bene insieme, ma non posso dire che tra di noi fosse nata un'amicizia, una grande intesa professionale questo s\u00ec. Gli ho pure fatto due case, una a Sabaudia, vicina a quello che ho curato per Moravia, l'altra a Viterbo. Eravamo l\u00ec a girare Il Vangelo secondo Matteo e lui aveva comprato una vecchia torre con due mura che erano ruderi. Ho realizzato una casa di vetro in modo da non dare fastidio ai ruderi, da non rovinare la rovina\".\n\nIl ricordo degli anni con Pasolini \u00e8 la narrazione degli anni di giovent\u00f9, di come una fascinazione si \u00e8 trasformata in una passione. \"Avevo sei o sette anni quando ho incontrato il cinema. Mi portavano i miei genitori la domenica. Allora mi piacevano certi filmacci in costume tipo Ercole al centro della Terra o Ercole alla conquista di Atlantide, oppure colossal americani come Ben-Hur. E l\u00ec \u00e8 nato il mio amore per il cinema. Avevo tredici anni e forse non avevo ancora chiaro cosa avrei voluto fare, ma sapevo che avrei fatto il cinema. Poi ho scoperto la scenografia\". Cos\u00ec comincia a studiare arte con tale slancio da essere sul set gi\u00e0 a diciassette anni.\n\nCresce l'interesse per il cinema di qualit\u00e0 e con esso lo sguardo attento di un produttore che dice \"questo \u00e8 bravo\": quindi il salto dalle produzione commerciali al cinema dei grandi maestri. \"Facevo - spiega - l'aiuto di Luigi Schiaccianoce. Allora, in quegli anni, succedeva che uno scenografo lavorasse su pi\u00f9 film in parallelo. Ad esempio il Satyricon l'ho finito io. Lui veniva una o due volte alla settimana sul set, poi andava, io concludevo il lavoro. E cos\u00ec \u00e8 accaduto con l'Edipo Re: arriviamo in Marocco, andiamo subito in albergo e al ristorante, e a quel punto Schiaccianoci mi dice: \"Caro Dante, ho 54 anni e queste cose non le posso pi\u00f9 fare. Io adesso finisco di mangiare prendo l'aereo e torno a Roma. Vuol dire che io far\u00f2 gli interni l\u00ec, intanto lei manda avanti le cose qua\". Il film fu fatto tutto in Marocco e girammo a Roma solo due settimane. Pasolini quando lo seppe si arrabbi\u00f2 moltissimo. Due anni dopo, era il 1969, mi chiam\u00f2 per Medea.\n\nMa \u00e8 con Scorsese che la carriera di Ferretti si sposta quasi a tempo pieno dall'altra parte dell'oceano, con il regista americano infatti conquista la sua terza nomination - per L'et\u00e0 dell'innocenza - e poi di nomination in nomination, due Oscar per The Aviator nel 2005 e per Hugo Cabret nel 2012. \"\u00c8 vero - dice - tranne che per i lavori teatrali o per i progetti di altro tipo, il mio lavoro nel cinema ormai si svolge per lo pi\u00f9 in America, e dire che a me piacerebbe stare di pi\u00f9 a Roma, questa \u00e8 la mia citt\u00e0, qui c'\u00e8 il mio studio\". Con qualche eccezione importante come quella volta che convinse Scorsese a girare Gangs of New York a Cinecitt\u00e0.\n\n\"Tutta colpa o merito del ristorante qui davanti. Scherzo naturalmente. Eravamo al Festival di Venezia per vedere un documentario sul cinema italiano e discutevamo su dove girare Gangs of New York. Abbiamo escluso l'America, perch\u00e9 girare a New York non sarebbe stato possibile, non c'era pi\u00f9 nulla della vecchia citt\u00e0, mentre si parlava come di destinazioni possibili del Canada e dell'Est Europa. Ed \u00e8 a questo punto che avanzo l'ipotesi Cinecitt\u00e0, che peraltro Scorsese conosceva gi\u00e0 visto che ci eravamo conosciuti proprio qui, sul set della Citt\u00e0 delle donne di Fellini. Allora lo convinco a fare una deviazione prima del suo rientro in America previsto per l'indomani, era un sabato. Ho cos\u00ec chiamato gli studi chiedendo di farci trovare tutto aperto. Poi il ristorante, ho prenotato raccomandandomi per un tavolo tranquillo. Dopo pranzo, complice il cibo buona e le chiacchiere, quando siamo tutti rilassati lo porto a fare un giro dei teatri. Rimane colpito al punto che mi dice: \"Ok, facciamolo qui\"\".","title":"\"Sbaglio apposta, perch\u00e9 cos\u00ec \u00e8 la vita\"","url":"http:\/\/www.ilsole24ore.com\/art\/commenti-e-idee\/2018-03-12\/sbaglio-apposta-perche-cosi-e-vita-104946.shtml?uuid=AEdLccBE","uri":"829804031","eventUri":null,"dateTime":"2018-03-12T09:58:00Z","date":"2018-03-12","source":{"title":"Il Sole 24 ORE","id":"12120","uri":"ilsole24ore.com"},"time":"09:58:00","isDuplicate":false,"wgt":2,"id":"226281850","sim":0},{"lang":"eng","body":"Whenever Pope Francis visits prisons, during his whirlwind trips to the world's peripheries or at a nearby jailhouse in Rome, he always tells inmates that he, too, could have ended up behind bars: \"Why you and not me?\" he asks.\n\nThat humble empathy and the ease with which he walks in others' shoes has won Francis admirers around the globe and confirmed his place as a consummate champion of the poor and disenfranchised.\n\nBut as he marks the fifth anniversary of his election Tuesday and looks ahead to an already troubled 2018, Francis faces criticism for both the merciful causes he has embraced and the ones he has neglected. With women and sex abuse topping the latter list, a consensus view is forming that history's first Latin American pope is perhaps a victim of unrealistic expectations and his own culture.\n\nNevertheless, Francis' first five years have been a dizzying introduction to a new kind of pope, one who prizes straight talk over theology and mercy over morals -- all for the sake of making the Church a more welcoming place for those who have felt excluded.\n\n\"I think he's fantastic, very human, very simple,\" Marina Borges Martinez, a 77-year-old retiree, said as she headed into evening Mass at a church in Sao Paulo, Brazil. \"I think he's managed to bring more people into the church with the way he is.\"\n\nMany point to his now famous \"Who am I to judge?\" comment about a gay priest as the turning point that disaffected Catholics had longed for and were unsure they would ever see.\n\nOthers hold out Francis' cautious opening to allowing Catholics who remarry outside the church to receive Communion as his single most revolutionary step. It was contained in a footnote to his 2016 document \"The Joy of Love.\"\n\n\"I have met people who told me they returned to the Catholic faith because of this pope,\" Ugandan Archbishop John Baptist Odama, who heads the local conference of Catholic bishops, said.\n\n\"Simple as he may be, he has passed a very powerful message about our God who loves everybody and who wants the salvation of everyone.\"\n\nAnother area in which Francis has sought change extends into global politics, with his demand for governments and individuals to treat migrants as brothers and sisters in need, not as threats to society's wellbeing and security.\n\nAfter a visit to a refugee camp in Lesbos, Greece, Francis brought a dozen Syrian Muslim refugees home with him on the papal plane. The Vatican has turned over three apartments to refugee families. Two African migrants recently joined the Vatican athletics team.\n\nHis call has gone largely unanswered in much of Europe and the United States, though, where opposing immigration has become a tool in political campaigns. Italians in the pope's backyard voted overwhelmingly this month for parties that have promised to crack down on migration, including with forced expulsions.\n\nThe Pew Research Center found that while Francis still enjoys a consistently high 84 percent favorability ratings among U.S. Catholics, an increasing number on the political right believe him to be \"too liberal\" and naive. Despite all the talk of \"the Francis effect\" bringing Catholics back to church, Pew found no evidence of a rise in self-proclaimed Catholics or Mass-goers.\n\nWhether he ultimately will be remembered as a unifying or divisive figure, the world has gotten to know the man formerly known as Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the son of Italian immigrants to Argentina who emerged on the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica as pope on March 13, 2013, and quipped that his brother cardinals had to search to the \"end of the Earth\" to find a new leader.\n\nThere have been magical moments: When Francis wept hearing the life story of an Albanian priest who was tortured during communist rule, and later made the clergyman a cardinal. When his whispery voice weakened as he met with Myanmar's Rohingya refugees and told them, \"The presence of God today is also called Rohingya.\"\n\nBut not all are pleased.\n\nWhen Francis created room for remarried Catholics to receive Communion, a few dozen traditionalist academics and clergy accused him of heresy. Four of his cardinals formally asked for clarification. Conservatives in the U.S. and Europe wrung their hands trying to square how Christ's vicar on Earth could seemingly condone adultery under the guise of mercy.\n\n\"At the end of the day, 'The Joy of Love' is the result of a new paradigm that Pope Francis is bringing forward,\" Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, said. \"Probably the difficulty that exists in the church is due to this change of attitude that the pope is asking for.\"\n\nOne cause Francis is accused of neglecting reared its head last week. A coalition of Catholic women gathered at Francis' own Jesuit headquarters in Rome to demand he provide women with a voice and a place at the decision-making table in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"Women's right to equality arises organically from divine justice. It does not and should not depend on ad hoc papal benevolence or magnaminity,\" former Irish President Mary McAleese said.\n\nTo be fair, Francis appointed a study commission on ordaining women deacons. He has named a woman to head the Vatican City's biggest cash cow, the Vatican Museums. He empowered ordinary priests, not just bishops, to absolve women who have had abortions and put Mary Magdalene on par with the male apostles by declaring a feast day in her honor.\n\nBut no woman heads a Holy See office, no woman sits on his kitchen cabinet. The Vatican's women's magazine ran a scathing expose this month of how nuns are treated like indentured servants by the bishops and cardinals they serve.\n\nThe other major unmet expectation is on the clerical sex abuse front. Francis set the bar high when he vowed \"zero tolerance\" for abuse, created an ad-hoc commission of experts to advise him and publicly pledged that bishops would be held accountable when they botched cases.\n\nBut he scrapped a planned tribunal to judge those bishops, allowed his advisory commission to lapse and most recently, shocked even his closest advisers by callously dismissing accusations of cover-up lodged by victims of Chile's most notorious predator priest.\n\nThe episode further cemented the impression that the 81-year-old Jesuit simply hasn't grasped how important the scandal is in many parts of the world, and how his papacy will be judged by it.","title":"Francis at 5: Paradigm shift in mercy, migrants and marriage","url":"http:\/\/www.thestate.com\/news\/nation-world\/world\/article204647024.html","uri":"829802618","eventUri":null,"dateTime":"2018-03-12T09:57:00Z","date":"2018-03-12","source":{"title":"The State","id":"320","uri":"thestate.com"},"time":"09:57:00","isDuplicate":false,"wgt":4,"id":"226281695","sim":0},{"lang":"por","body":"Roma, 12 mar (EFE).- O l\u00edder do Partido Democr\u00e1tico (PD) da It\u00e1lia, Matteo Renzi, que renunciar\u00e1 ao cargo nesta segunda-feira, afirmou que a legenda n\u00e3o far\u00e1 alian\u00e7as com a Liga Norte ou com o Movimento 5 Estrelas (M5S) para formar um novo governo no pa\u00eds.\n\n\"Nenhuma colabora\u00e7\u00e3o com o MS5 ou com a direita \u00e9 poss\u00edvel\", disse o ex-primeiro-ministro da It\u00e1lia em entrevista publicada pelo jornal \"Corriere della Sera\"\n\nRenzi afirmou que seu ciclo na dire\u00e7\u00e3o do PD terminou, mas que viveu \"quatro anos muito dif\u00edceis e lindos\".
